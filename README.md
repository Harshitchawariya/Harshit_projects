**Tasks**

1. Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (top 10%). Include only those tweets that have received more than 50 likes and were posted on weekdays and this graph should only work between 1 PM to 4PM as well as tweet word count be below 30.

2. Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work between 3 PM to 6 PM and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30

3. Develop a visualization that compares the number of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets that have received media engagements greater than the median value. Include a filter for tweets posted in between June and August of 2020 and this graph should work between 3 PM to 6 PM and tweet date should be odd number and media views should be even number as well as tweet word count be below 50.
